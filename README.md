# Yuntao's Personal Webpage

I am designing my website for my course project. My current version has four web pages in total. I am using flexbox as the layout method; each page contains different flex containers and will dynamically rearrange content based on the page width. Details about all pages and content are shown below.
1.	Index page contains the basic introduction about me.
2.	Courses page contains information about all the courses that I took during the past and my class schedule for this semester.
3.	Research page contains an introduction about my research lab and group.
4.	Contact page contains a form that could interact with users.
